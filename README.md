# Predict Laptop Prices Based on Ram,Cpu,Memory,Windows
Using machine learning which is trained less amount of laptop prices which is around 15 \
The program can predict the Laptop prices based on Ram,Cpu,Memory,Windows.
:smile: just input the `ram,cpu,memory,window` and it will predict the the price of laptop
## Setup & Simple Usage:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open prediction.csv and write the details of laptop you want
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and open the predictor.ipynb
4. Run the code with Juypter Notebook
5. And here you go, you can check the prediction on the prediction.csv
## Here are some Predictions:
| Ram  | Cpu | Memory | Windows | Price |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 16  | 7  | 2000  | 11  | 100000 |
| 36  | 9  | 3000  | 11  | 160000 |
| 2  | 3  | 128  | 10  | 22000 |
| 8  | 5  | 500 | 10  | 58000 |
| 16  | 7  | 512  | 11  | 96000 |
## Check predictor.ipynb for the code.
## Note
You can change the laptop_prices.csv to your data. I found these data on a shooping website you can put your data and predict based on your data.
